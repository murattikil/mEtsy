1. Prevent the bot from faving more than 300 items per hour:
 - Before each fave check the number of faves done during this hour.
    - if the hour now is different than last saved hour, set the faves count to 1, and log the new Date
 - After each successful fave increment the number of faves for this hour.
 - In database keep info for faves count and the Date, favesTrack:
   {
    date: new Date(),
    count: 10
   }
 -

2. Write code that will switch between different modes (faving items, faving shops etc) depending on:
 - We've hit the hourly item faves limit
 - We've specified such behavior in extension's settings

3. Implement functionality for faving shops
4. Investigate about groups that do exchanging of faving shops and implement functionality that will visit such groups and fave member's shops
